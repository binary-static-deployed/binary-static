                        <p>The promotion of the Company and the distribution of this Information Memorandum in the United Kingdom is restricted by Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (the "Act").</p>
                        <p>This Information Memorandum is being issued in the United Kingdom by the Company to, and/or is directed at, persons to whom it may lawfully be issued or directed at under The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2001 including persons who are authorised under the Act ("authorised persons"), certain persons having professional experience in matters relating to investments, high net worth companies, high net worth unincorporated associations or partnerships, trustees of high value trusts and persons who qualify as certified sophisticated investors. The Tokens are only available to such persons in the United Kingdom and this Information Memorandum must not be relied or acted upon by any other persons in the United Kingdom. In order to qualify as a certified sophisticated investor a person must: (a) have a certificate in writing or other legible form signed by an authorised person to the effect that he is sufficiently knowledgeable to understand the risks associated with participating in such investments; and (b) have signed, within the last 12 months, a statement in a prescribed form declaring, amongst other things, that he qualifies as a sophisticated investor in relation to such investments. This Information Memorandum is exempt from the general restriction in Section 21 of the Act on the communication of invitations or inducements to engage in investment activity on the grounds that it is being issued to and/or directed at only the types of person referred to above.</p>
                        <p>The content of this Information Memorandum has not been approved by an authorised person and such approval is, save where this Information Memorandum is directed at or issued to the types of person referred to above, required by Section 21 of the Act. Acquiring Tokens may expose an investor to a significant risk of losing all of the amount invested. Any person who is in any doubt about investing in the Company should consult an authorised person specialising in advising on such investments.</p>
                        <p>This Information Memorandum is an invitation to treat and may only be received by authorised persons. If an authorised person wishes to bid for Tokens he may do so if he has a binary.com account, by which method the Company shall be able to verify his qualifications as an authorised person. The prospective investor who wishes to acquire Tokens will make a bid.  The Company will collate and assess the bids.  The Company may request that bids are reconfirmed before they are considered valid for the purpose of the offer at the Auction.  At the Auction the Company will make an offer for the Tokens, which offer will be accepted (by the process explained below) by the bids, and the consideration for the purchase of such Tokens offered and accepted will be settled by credit in the prospective investor's Binary.com account, which evidences the contract for sale and purchase of the respective Tokens.</p>

For purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Tokens to the public” in any relevant member state means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Tokens to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Tokens, as the expression may be varied in that member state by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that member state.</p>
                        <p>In the case of any Tokens being offered to a financial intermediary as that term is used in Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, such financial intermediary will also be deemed to have represented, warranted, and agreed to and with the Company that: (i) Tokens acquired by it have not been acquired on behalf of, nor have they been acquired with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in any relevant member state other than qualified investors; or (ii) where Tokens have been acquired by it on behalf of persons in any relevant member state other than qualified investors, the offer of those Tokens is not treated under the Prospectus Directive as having been made to such persons.
