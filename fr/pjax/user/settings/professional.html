            <ul class="checked">
                <li>You have carried out transactions, in significant size, on the relevant market that we are going to offer you, at an average frequency of 10 per quarter of the previous four quarters; and/or</li>
                <li>The size of your instrument portfolio (including Instruments &amp; Cash), with us or elsewhere, exceeds EUR500,000, or the equivalent; and/or</li>
                <li>You have worked in the financial sector for at least 1 year in a professional position that requires knowledge of the envisaged transactions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>By opting to be treated as a Professional Client, we shall not presume that you possess market knowledge and experience as defined by the term 'Professional Client'. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your request for this Categorization meets the aforementioned criteria, including, but not limited to copies of:</p>
            <ul class="bullet">
                <li>Statements reflecting your transactions of the previous four quarters;</li>

            <p>As a Professional Client, you are responsible for keeping the Company informed about any change which could affect your categorization as a Professional Client.
