The problem that is solved here is what\n        // happens if the user logs out or switches loginid in one\n        // window while keeping another window or tab open. This can\n        // lead to unintended trades. The solution is to reload the\n        // page in all windows after switching loginid or after logout.\n\n        // onLoad.queue does not work on the home page.\n        // jQuery's ready function works always.\n        $(document).ready(() => {\n            // Cookies is not always available.\n            // So, fall back to a more basic solution.\n            window.addEventListener('storage', (evt) => {\n                switch (evt.key) {\n                    case 'active_loginid':\n                        // reload the page when the client changes account on other pages.\n                        if (evt.newValue === '' || !window.is_logging_in) {\n                            reload();\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case 'new_release_reload_time':\n                        if (evt.newValue !== evt.oldValue) {\n                            reload(true);\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    // no default\n                }\n            });\n            scrollToTop();\n        });\n    };\n\n    const onLoad = () => {\n        if (State.get('is_loaded_by_pjax')) {\n            Url.reset();\n            updateLinksURL('#content');\n        } else {\n            init();\n            if (!isLoginPages()) {\n                Language.setCookie(Language.urlLang());\n\n                if (!ClientBase.get('is_virtual')) {\n                    // TODO: uncomment below to enable interview popup dialog\n                    // InterviewPopup.onLoad();\n                }\n            }\n            Header.onLoad();\n            Footer.onLoad();\n            Language.setCookie();\n            Menu.makeMobileMenu();\n            updateLinksURL('body');\n            recordAffiliateExposure();\n            endpointNotification();\n        }\n        Contents.onLoad();\n\n        if (sessionStorage.getItem('showLoginPage')) {\n            sessionStorage.removeItem('showLoginPage');\n            Login.redirectToLogin();\n        }\n        if (Client.isLoggedIn()) {\n            BinarySocket.wait('authorize', 'website_status', 'get_account_status').then(() => {\n                RealityCheck.onLoad();\n                Menu.init();\n            });\n        } else {\n            Menu.init();\n            if (!LocalStore.get('date_first_contact')) {\n                BinarySocket.wait('time').then((response) => {\n                    LocalStore.set('date_first_contact', toISOFormat(moment(response.time * 1000).utc()));\n                });\n            }\n            if (!LocalStore.get('signup_device')) {\n                LocalStore.set('signup_device', (isMobile() ?
