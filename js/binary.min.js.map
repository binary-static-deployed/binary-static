The solution is to reload the\n        // page in all windows after switching loginid or after logout.\n\n        // onLoad.queue does not work on the home page.\n        // jQuery's ready function works always.\n        $(document).ready(function () {\n            // Cookies is not always available.\n            // So, fall back to a more basic solution.\n            window.addEventListener('storage', function (evt) {\n                switch (evt.key) {\n                    case 'active_loginid':\n                        // not the active tab and logged out or loginid switch\n                        if (document.hidden && (evt.newValue === '' || !window.is_logging_in)) {\n                            reload();\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    case 'new_release_reload_time':\n                        if (evt.newValue !== evt.oldValue) {\n                            reload(true);\n                        }\n                        break;\n                    // no default\n                }\n            });\n            scrollToTop();\n        });\n    };\n\n    var onLoad = function onLoad() {\n        if (State.get('is_loaded_by_pjax')) {\n            Url.reset();\n        } else {\n            init();\n            if (!Login.isLoginPages()) {\n                Language.setCookie(Language.urlLang());\n            }\n            Localize.forLang(Language.urlLang());\n            Header.onLoad();\n            Language.setCookie();\n            Menu.makeMobileMenu();\n            recordAffiliateExposure();\n            endpointNotification();\n        }\n        Contents.onLoad();\n\n        if (sessionStorage.getItem('showLoginPage')) {\n            sessionStorage.removeItem('showLoginPage');\n            Login.redirectToLogin();\n        }\n        if (Client.isLoggedIn()) {\n            BinarySocket.wait('authorize', 'website_status', 'get_account_status').then(function () {\n                checkLanguage();\n                RealityCheck.onLoad();\n                Menu.init();\n            });\n        } else {\n            checkLanguage();\n            Menu.init();\n        }\n        TrafficSource.setData();\n    };\n\n    var recordAffiliateExposure = function recordAffiliateExposure() {\n        var token = Url.param('t');\n        if (!token || token.length !== 32) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        AffiliatePopup.show();\n\n        var token_length = token.length;\n        var is_subsidiary = /\\w{1}/.test(Url.param('s'));\n\n        var cookie_token = Cookies.getJSON('affiliate_tracking');\n        if (cookie_token) {\n            // Already exposed to some other affiliate.\n            if (is_subsidiary && cookie_token && cookie_token.t) {\n                return false;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // Record the affiliate exposure.
